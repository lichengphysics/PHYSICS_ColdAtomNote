\section{Homogeneous Bose Gas}
Hamiltonian of Homogeneous Bose Gas is given by
\begin{equation}
H-\mu N = \sum_k a_k^\dag a_k (\epsilon_k -\mu) +\frac{g}{2V} \sum_{k,k',q} a_{-k'+q}^\dag a_{k'+q}^\dag a_{k+q}a_{k'+q}
\end{equation}
Here the Hamiltonian is written in $k$ space of a grand-canonical assemble. $\epsilon_k = \hbar k^2/2m$, non-interacting kinetic energy, $V$ is Volume, and $g=\frac{4\pi\hbar^2 a_s}{m}$ is interaction, where $a_s$ is scattering length. The interaction part is a typical two particle scattering process. And here we take $g > 0$.

Let's talk a bit of interaction $g$ and scattering length $a_s$ first.
